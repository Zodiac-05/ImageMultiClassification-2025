# Workout Exercise Image Classification

## Project Description

This project performs **multiclass classification** of **workout exercise images**.  
Given an image of a person performing an exercise, the model predicts the correct exercise name.

The project was done as part of an assignment for image classification using deep learning.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is:  
  ðŸ“¦ [Workout Exercises Dataset (Images Only) by Harvineet Singh](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harpdec/exercise-images-dataset)
- Size: ~800 MB
- It contains images extracted from videos and Google images.
- Classes include exercises like `bench press`, `barbell biceps curl`, `plank`, `deadlift`, etc.

**Note**:  
The dataset is NOT uploaded here due to size limits.  
Please download the dataset manually from Kaggle and extract it under `data/workout-images/`.

## Model Choices

Two models were used:

1. **EfficientNetB0** (Pretrained on ImageNet):
   - Used transfer learning by fine-tuning last few layers.
   - Achieved very high accuracy (~90% validation accuracy).

2. **Custom CNN** (built from scratch):
   - 4 convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.
   - Provides more control and no dependency on pretrained weights.

**Switching Models**:  
You can easily switch between models by changing one line in `config.py`:

```python
model_name = 'EfficientNetB0'  # for pretrained EfficientNet
# OR
model_name = 'CustomCNN'  # for training custom CNN from scratch
